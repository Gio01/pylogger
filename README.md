<h1>Pylogger: Keylogger & Detector</h1>

The idea behind making this project is to learn some hacking techniques and understand how they work.
Currently Pylogger contains a basic Keylogger implementation that can successfully record keystrokes.

In addition there is a basic Keylogger Detector for the same Keylogger attack implemented in Pylogger. 
This KLDetector is able to find the process of the Keylogger running and is able to kill it to ensure that keystrokes are not recorded.

(Pylogger is developed for Linux.)
